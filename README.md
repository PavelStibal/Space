## How to play

## Goal and description game
The goal of the game is to kill "Boss" to win. Before you reach the boss, other enemy ships will be attacked by you to 
destroy you by shooting or collisions, which will completely destroy them.
You can destroy enemy ships by shooting or collisions, which will give you some health.
If you pick up power up, using powerups you can upgrade your weapon or add some health if you are no longer full health

## Structure
The structure of the folder is the following:
- `root` - Static html files
    - `js/` - JS files for the game (the core of the EC6)
    - `style/` - My CSS style
    - `resource/` - Here you can find images and sounds
